Major changes:
 * Hosted on Github. Thanks, Google. [DC]

Functions:
 * element() is now an alias for match(). Suggested by Wiggles. [985-TK]
 * filter() and filterbool() can now be passed additional arguments, for
   Rhost compatability. Requested by Volund. [1019-MG] [Rhost]
 * valid() can now validate timezones, locktypes and lockkeys. Suggested by 
   Volund. [1021,1025-MG]
 * convtime() now returns #-1, instead of -1, on error. This change is
   -backwards incompatible-, but necessary as -1 is a potentially valid output
   for convtime(). Suggested by KimikoMuffin. [1010-MG]
 * convsecs() can now accept negative inputs when Extended convtime() is
   available. Suggested by Volund. [1010-MG]
 * avg() is now an alias for mean(). [1023-TK] [Rhost]
